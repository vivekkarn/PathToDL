# Path to Deep Learning

## Step 1:

### Basics of python

- variable assigning, functions, lists, tuples, set, dictionary, list comprehensions, list manipulations, etc

## Step 2:

### Algorithms and Data structure by interviewcake

- You can get it free if you apply for Github students pack. If you want to buy it then they are giving 75% discounts for the corona outbreak.

- WHY?

      	- Programming is not just coding but being able to solve problems as well.

      	- Better problem-solving ability will be a boost during learning data science.

## Step 3:

### Data Analysis

- Data cleaning, processing, analyzing and visualizing is a must for every Deep Learning expert.

- We will learn Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib and seaborn.

## Step 4 :

### Deep Learning with Pytorch

**Day 1**: Deep Learning with PyTorch: A 60 Minute Blitz and some Googling

**Remaining days**: Applied Deep Learning with PyTorch on freecodecamp

- Not tensorflow because their APIs and syntax keep changing so much that it becomes hard to keep track of.
- We shall learn sklearn, pandas and matplotlib as and when required alongside from their documentaion.
- If the quarrantine still remains, we shall move over to Kaggle and try some challenges.
