# Path to Deep Learning

## Week 1:

### Basics of python

- variable assigning, functions, lists, tuples, set, dictionary, list comprehensions, list manipulations, etc

## Week 2 & 3:

### Algorithms and Data structure by interviewcake

- You can get it free if you apply for Github students pack. If you want to buy it then they are giving 75% discounts for the corona outbreak.

- WHY?

      	- Programming is not just coding but being able to solve problems as well.

      	- Better problem-solving ability will be a boost during learning data science.

## Week 4 & 5 :

### Deep Learning with Pytorch

**Day 1**: Deep Learning with PyTorch: A 60 Minute Blitz and some Googling

**Remaining days**: Applied Deep Learning with PyTorch on freecodecamp

- Not tensorflow because their APIs and syntax keep changing so much that it becomes hard to keep track of.
- We shall learn sklearn, pandas and matplotlib as and when required alongside from their documentaion.
- If the quarrantine still remains, we shall move over to Kaggle and try some challenges.

This is a gross plan. It can be changed if we find something better. I have completed week 1 and here is the jupyter notebook of it.

If you guys are also interested lets make a team and move forward. We can discuss confusions and difficult topics together, making our learning better and faster.
Please donot overcrowd it just for the sake of joining the group if you're not interested.
